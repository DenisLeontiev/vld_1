      <h2 class="h3" id="first">What is forex trading?</h2>
      <p>Forex is the single largest traded market globally, with up to five trillion traded each day and is considered decentralized because there is no central processor for trades– in other words, there is no entity that acts as a central exchange like the NASDAQ or the NYSE. Instead, orders are completed by millions of traders using millions of various forex brokers around the world.</p>
      <p>Foreign currency trading is one of the most leveraged markets in the world as well. In the US, regulations limit a person to 50:1 leverage. In other countries, they have zero limits on leverage. It is not uncommon to see some non-US brokers offer 1000+:1. Due to these factors and a few others which we will discuss, this is why scams can be so prevalent within the foreign exchange market.</p>
      <h2 class="h3" id="second">Key points</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using a regulated broker ensures that: your money is safe, the data and information provided by the broker are compliant with industry standards, and the broker is operating legitimately and ethically.</li>
        <li>The forex trading space is rife with services and individuals bent on defrauding new traders. Avoid bad brokers, false education programs, performance history lies, and fraudulent automated trading systems.</li>
        <li>If you have been the victim of a scam in the forex space – there are options available to you, provided by our specialist at Payback LTD.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h3" id="third">How to spot a forex scam</h2>
      <p>The scams that exist in the investment world are many. One of the hardest things for new and aspiring traders to overcome is the vast amount of wrong information, bad actors and blacklisted scam brokers trying to take advantage of you.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the different types of forex trading scams:</p>
      <h2 class="h3">Broker’s Leverage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The US and EU (more recently) have limits of around 50:1.</li>
        <li>If you see a broker offering 500:1, 1000:1, or anything beyond a conservative amount, stay away. This is a predatory action.</li>
        <li>Avoid any broker that is not clear about margin requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h3">Broker’s undisclosed parameters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid requirements for a minimum Stop Loss or Profit Target</li>
        <li>Avoid requirements where you must have a trade open for a certain amount of time before you can exit.</li>
        <li>Avoid anyone that doesn’t allow you to create your own risk management profile.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h3">Broker withdrawal rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You should be able to withdraw your money from your brokerage account at will – but some don’t allow this.</li>
        <li>Avoid minimum requirements for volume traded before you can withdraw.</li>
        <li>Avoid anyone that doesn’t disclose their withdrawal rules.</li>
        <li>If a broker advertises a bonus on deposits, make sure that you can withdraw the bonus within a reasonable amount of time – it should be clear what the requirements are for you to withdraw the bonus.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h3">Broker’s spread</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The spread is the difference between the Bid (buying) and the Ask (selling) – This should be clearly defined or be avoided.</li>
        <li>Avoid brokers that don’t warn you of regular increases in the spreads, such as at the end of the day or during certain holidays.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h3">Signal Sellers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Forex signal sellers are individuals who want to sell you signals or advice – they want to tell you what pairs to buy or short, when to exit for profit, where to put your stops, etc.</li>
        <li>Millions of signal sellers out there are all selling you on their success with messages like, “3,000 pips a week!” – a pip is how you measure movement in the exchange rate. The average pip range that the EUR/USD moves a day can vary between 30 to 50 pips.</li>
        <li>Avoid people or companies that promise or allude to a guarantee of profit. Avoid entities that promise unbelievable returns like: “90% win rate!” or “188 winning trades, 12 losing trades!” or “MASSIVE GAINS.”</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h3">
        Broker spam
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid sites that have side advertisements and banners promoting a single broker.</li>
        <li>
          Avoid anyone or anything that recommends a single broker
          <ul>
            <li>People who promote a single broker generally have some agreement with them. Many non-US brokers offer various incentives for people to find new customers. They may offer the seller a cut of your deposit or a rebate on any trade you make.</li>
            <li>If someone tells you about a broker or if a site is promoting a broker – ask if they have an IB (introducing broker) agreement with them– this must be disclosed in the US when asked.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h3">Educational services</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Be wary of the myriad of free or paid trading education opportunities</li>
        <li>Many sites look incredibly professional and may even link certification organizations without their permission.</li>
        <li>
          Check for quality educational providers from the CMT Association (Certified Market Technicians Association), IFTA (International Fellowship of Technical Analysts), or STA (Society of Technical Analysts).
          <ul>
            <li>Even by professional US brokers, a significant amount of the education provided is decades out of date.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h3">Automated Trading or Artificial Intelligence (Bots or Robots)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It is best to avoid anyone selling forex robot trading systems</li>
        <li>AI systems have existed since the 1990s for retail investors– but nearly 100% of them fail.</li>
        <li>The current buzzword for investment scams is ‘AI.’ Avoid anyone that claims they use Artificial Intelligence. There are only two known private hedge funds that have anything close to authentic self-learning AI. They are not selling their bots to anyone.</li>
        <li>Think about this logically: If you created a profitable AI (virtually a money printing machine), would you ever tell anyone about it? Would you sell it? Probably not – your advantage disappears when others have access to that kind of a tool.</li>
        <li>Automated Trading systems are a common way fraud is committed by forex scammers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h3">Flashy advertising or false lifestyles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid any service or individual who has ‘high lifestyle’ imagery, such as girls in bikinis on a yacht, Lamborghini or Ferrari in the background, massive mansion or house, or a private jet.</li>
        <li>A good rule to follow for any investment or speculative endeavor: if it looks or sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h3" id="fourth">How do I recover funds from a forex scam?</h2>
